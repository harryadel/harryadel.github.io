## 🌟 Why Support Me?

I've been actively contributing to the Meteor community ever since I joined it—whether through actual development work or simply spreading the good word about Meteor. 

Open source takes significant time and effort, often pulling away from my personal projects and income-generating work. I'd love to turn these OSS efforts into something greater and, who knows, maybe even work full-time on open source someday!
