This marks the first dev diary of 2025. Due to increased workloads at my job, open source contributions have unfortunately taken a back seat this month. I'm hoping things will improve as I settle into my new work responsibilities and find a better balance.

## Collection2 Revival

The most significant update I'd like to share is my revival of German Jan's work on [collection2](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2/pull/447). My primary focus is adding Zod support, though I recognize the value of implementing this in a more generic way. The goal is to create an abstraction that isn't too tightly coupled to Zod specifically, allowing for potential integration with other validation libraries in the future.

Backward compatibility remains a major priority in this effort. I'm working carefully within the boundaries of the existing test suite to ensure everything continues to function as expected. This approach helps preserve compatibility while adding new functionality.

I'll be sharing a new beta release soon for community testing and feedback. Thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to sharing more substantial updates next month!
