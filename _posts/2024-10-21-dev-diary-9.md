Greetings, everyone!

This month, we've made significant progress with the underscore PRs. I'm pleased to report that nearly all of them have been successfully merged. The only exception is the [final PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/12268), which is responsible for deprecating the package. 

While we encountered a few minor obstacles along the way, I'm grateful for Leonardo's timely intervention. He created a [pull request](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13422) that effectively addressed these issues and tied up any loose ends.

It's worth noting that this underscore work began back in 2022. The fact that it's only now reaching completion serves as a powerful reminder that open-source software development often requires considerable patience. Despite the extended timeline, this has been an incredibly valuable experience that has taught me a great deal about the nuances of long-term project management and community collaboration.

With the underscore project finally nearing its conclusion, I'm excited to shift my focus to new challenges and opportunities within the Meteor ecosystem. The successful completion of this long-standing task opens up possibilities for tackling other important issues and enhancements.

I look forward to sharing more updates on my future endeavors in the coming months. Until then, keep coding and contributing!
