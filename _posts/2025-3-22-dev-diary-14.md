I released a [new beta](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2/pull/447/commits/9300b590be8b89b359945dd371b7d6adb62f36ee) version of collection2, which should help fix an issue I encountered with Zod schemas. I think the Zod implementation is somewhat stable now, but I cannot fully commit to it unless someone tests it out.

I also helped debug a problem with Tailwind on the [forums](https://forums.meteor.com/t/tailwind-in-meteor-3-app-with-existing-scss-code/63209/13?u=harry97). I believe Tailwind works properly with version 3, but version 4 might have some issues.

The biggest highlight of this month's update is probably my latest piece on [3.0 migration](https://forums.meteor.com/t/the-meteor-3-0-migration-a-space-exploration-mission/63316/5), where I explained how we finally managed to migrate our application to 3.0 while providing advice on how others can do the same. Concurrently, I also created my [Cal](https://cal.com/harryadel) account so anybody can schedule a quick call with me if they'd like.

Lastly, I've been working on a Meteor backend application where the methods will be consumed by a React Native frontend, so I wanted to try out Meteorman. Unfortunately, it only supports Debian packages, so I made a new [PR](https://github.com/antwaremx/meteorman/pull/15) to add support for Arch Linux distro. This marks my very first [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/meteorman) package, and I'm quite proud of it.
