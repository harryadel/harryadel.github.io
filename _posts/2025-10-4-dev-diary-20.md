Whew, another month has passed! This officially marks my twentieth blog post, or in other words, a consistent 20-month effort of conducting open source work. I'm glad I've stayed consistent enough.

Now onto the changes:

Probably the biggest highlight of this month is the release of Veliovgroup's Meteor-Files [v3.0.1](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/pull/895). While my [PR](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/pull/903) didn't get merged, I'm glad it inspired Dmitriy. Huge shoutout to Dmitriy for his consistent work. You might want to check out his service [Ostr.io](https://ostr.io/).

My efforts to migrate [Caught](https://caught.nu/) to 3.0 are still underway, and thanks to their patronage, I've been religiously migrating the Meteor-partitioner package. The latest beta currently out is [0.7.0-beta-12](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-partitioner/pull/38/commits/cf8cf53c564b8d7907d9b0cb18f7a4d67723fc26). I've noticed that bumping the minor version is suboptimal, so I'll probably do a major bump once I'm done.

[apollo-live-client](https://github.com/harryadel/apollo-live-client) is now async compliant and ready for Meteor 3.0.

I also decided to do a little side quest and feature Meteor on the parcel-bundler repo: https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher/pull/214

A new beta version of collection2 that supports Zod v4 is out: https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2/pull/447#issuecomment-3250047107 I'm awaiting your feedback so I know what the next steps are.

Lastly, I did fiddle a bit with Meteor packaging system and came up with a [PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13923). It's still in the works, and [zodern's comment](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13923#issuecomment-3301075850) made me doubt it a bit, but hey, it was fun looking into Meteor's internals.
