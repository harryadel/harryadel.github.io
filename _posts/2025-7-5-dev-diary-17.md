As I've explained in my previous diary but my OSS endeavours are going to take a backseat position in my life. This decision is a result of both professional and personal issues. Though fret not, I'll still be around and I try to at least make a single OSS contribution to the Meteor community once a month. 

[meteor companies list](https://github.com/harryadel/awesome-meteor-jobs/blob/master/README.md) got updated where I removed [Ledgy](https://ledgy.com/) since they no longer use Meteor and moved to [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), added [ZipBoard](https://zipboard.co/) which is a Canadian company that uses Meteor to build their software, along with other Czech companies [Robotict](https://robotict.com/company/career) and [Agdata](https://agdata.ag/en/kariera/#developer). No wonder Jan likes Meteor lol, it's in his genetics.



Meteor Files also got a [PR](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/pull/903) where a bug regarding the cookies was fixed. While the solution was trivial it impacted 'protected' images feature and made it no working. So, it's highly crucial that Dimitry merges it and releases a new RC in time.


Lastly, while working on accounts feature, I noticed the links in the documentation weren't working so I pushed a little [PR](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13822#pullrequestreview-2978092471).
