Hello again,

The biggest star of this month is the release of a [new beta](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2/pull/447#issuecomment-2830039701) for collection2 `4.1.1-beta.4`. This new beta addresses some of the potential problems highlighted by [9Morello](https://github.com/9morello), most notably support for $addToSet and $push along with other issues. Work on this improvement opened up a can of worms on many future issues and generally the future of collection2 and how it fits in Meteor.

I helped around in Meteor-Files by [updating](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/pull/900) some of the example code. The package is highly stable now and close to being done. I encourage you all to give it a go and report any remaining problems [here](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-Files/pull/895) before the full release is made.

Lastly, [`Accounts.replaceEmailAsync`](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13677) is now a part of the 3.3 release. I'm always pleased to contribute to Meteor accounts.
