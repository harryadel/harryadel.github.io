This month has seen significant progress in making more packages async-compliant across the Meteor ecosystem. Here are the key developments:

## Meteor-Autoform Beta
Jan KÃ¼ster has been working tirelessly on a new beta release for meteor-autoform. I recently conducted a [review](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-autoform/pull/1737) of the changes, and I'm pleased to report that the modifications were surprisingly minimal. The new version should be ready for release soon.

## Collection-Hooks Update
We've released a [new version](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection-hooks/pull/306#issuecomment-2500791240) of collection-hooks that addresses the remaining issues. In aligning with the underlying MongoDB API, we've made `find` operations synchronous going forward. This represents a breaking change from the 2.x version. We encourage you to test this package in your applications, as your feedback is crucial before we proceed with the full release.

## Logger Package Updates
While browsing the forums, I noticed concerns about some Meteor logging packages lacking Meteor 3.0 compatibility. In response, I've submitted two pull requests to address these issues:
- [Meteor-logger Update](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-logger/pull/24)
- [Meteor-logger-mongo Update](https://github.com/veliovgroup/Meteor-logger-mongo/pull/26)

Looking forward to sharing more updates next month. See you then!
