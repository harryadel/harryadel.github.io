A bit later than usual, but it's ok. May has been filled with lots of educational work rather than regular PR-type work.

I took a deep dive into the [meteor authentication system](https://harryadel.github.io/meteor-authentication/) and during my work on it, this led me to learn about publications. So I wrote up another piece on [publications](https://harryadel.github.io/auto-publications/).

Though I'm especially proud of my recent work on [Grapher](https://github.com/bhunjadi/grapher/pull/4) package where I replaced [sift](https://github.com/crcn/sift.js) with [mingo](https://github.com/kofrasa/mingo). I've been working heavily with Grapher at my current job, and I must say it's such a learning experience. I got to dig deep into it and learn about some of its internal structures and how it works. Particularly, how it manages to preserve the structure of the data on the client even when still using publications. Really ingenious package, it made me ponder on the big loss that the Meteor community suffered when [Theodor](https://github.com/theodorDiaconu) left. I don't want to keep hammering this, but you get the point.

On a side note, I intend to dial back my OSS work. I'll still contribute to Meteor and the community but at a lesser rate, as I believe my professional development took a hit and my emphasis on Meteor didn't really take me as far as I had hoped. More on that later, but I just wanted to give you a heads up.
