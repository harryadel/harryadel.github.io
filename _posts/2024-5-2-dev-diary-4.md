Greetings! This month contains lots of code and package updates, unlike the previous month. A new version of [aldeed:collection2](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2/pull/449) is being worked on, that allows Collection2 to be compatible with the latest RC and fixes a minor bug.

I also updated [tmeasday:check-npm-versions](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/check-npm-versions/pull/45) , it's used across many packages and compatibility is must for other packages to work. Same goes for [ostrio:autoform-files](https://github.com/veliovgroup/meteor-autoform-file/pull/63) 

Jan Kuster has been putting out incredible work, and he asked me to review [meteor-collection-extensions](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection-extensions/pull/26#pullrequestreview-2014768891)and [mongo-collection-instances](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/mongo-collection-instances/pull/40#pullrequestreview-2014789500), so expect new versions.

Meteor released a [promotional video](https://twitter.com/meteorjs/status/1785393775910469646) that I had recorded previously for 3.0, encouraging others to start updating their applications and share their experiences on the forum. This way, others can benefit and speed up the migration process.
