This month has been much more fruitful in terms of OSS contributions. I returned to my underscore PRs: [mongo](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13312) got merged, and I updated the [ddp-client](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/12261) PR. I shall continue my work on these projects.

Jan released [v4](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-roles/pull/379) of meteor-roles, which is a significant milestone. He has also been accepted to give a talk at the [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/) about Meteor. He's looking to offset some of the costs associated with this opportunity. Jan has been putting in a great effort to represent Meteor and spread the word. If you can spare a few bucks, that would be awesome â€“ every bit counts.

[msavin:sjobs](https://github.com/msavin/SteveJobs/pull/112) received a whole new set of fixes and updates thanks to the community: [#5](https://github.com/harryadel/SteveJobs/pull/5), [#4](https://github.com/harryadel/SteveJobs/pull/4), and [#3](https://github.com/harryadel/SteveJobs/pull/3). I can't believe I missed those bugs, but thankfully, the community has my back on this one.

I also updated the [Excel spreadsheet](https://forums.meteor.com/t/looking-for-help-migrating-packages-to-meteor-3-0/60985/87) to the best of my ability. If you think there's something missing, please let me know.

I pushed a minor improvement to ostrio:files in this [pull request](https://github.com/bratelefant/Meteor-Files/pull/2), which should allow you to use `onBeforeUpload` asynchronously.

Lastly, I want to bring your attention to a very important subject. Meteor is considering adding the meteor-roles package to the core. I [chimed in](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions/13357#discussioncomment-10679522) and shared what I believe is the best approach, in my opinion. I think others should weigh in too. Now that we're free from the constraints of fibers, the next steps are crucial in deciding the future of Meteor, and this decision cannot be taken lightly.
