Greetings! This month has seen minimal effort on my part in terms of OSS, as I'm busy with some private endeavors that I'll announce soon.

Last month, I helped push efforts on the [SteveJobs](https://github.com/msavin/SteveJobs/pull/112) package, which is now awaiting final review before release.

Also, at my company, we're currently facing a [problem](https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push/issues/282) with building our Cordova application on our 3.0 branch. We'd greatly appreciate any input you folks might have. I've spoken with Nacho and Renan, and both agreed it might have to do with outdated Cordova dependencies. They couldn't update dependencies during the [last update](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/12785) beyond certain versions due to Node.js 14 limitations. Nacho said this problem is already under consideration and will be tackled in the next release, which is set to hit late August. So, we shall see.

If you've any suggestions or feedback, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HarryAdel2).
