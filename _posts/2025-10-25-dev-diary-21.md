We're wrapping up an intense month this time. Right off the bat, [lai:collection-extensions](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/13830) has been merged into the core finally, and now it's [stated](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection-extensions/commit/0d4bb5ab5f3f720be6f98f3ffa8fab3ed87aa58a) clearly to use the core utilities instead of the package.

This marks the death of a second collections-related package; the first was [mongo-collection-instances](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/mongo-collection-instances#warning). This was touched upon in a previous [community post](https://forums.meteor.com/t/collection2-future/61294) where I discussed whether Astronomy should be merged into collection2 or not. But now two of the big collection utilities are offered directly by the core.

[wildhart:jobs](https://github.com/wildhart/meteor.jobs/pull/31) has been made 3.x friendly. Hopefully the original author has some time to look into it and approve it!

Meteor Grapher is pending [quality of life changes](https://github.com/bhunjadi/grapher/pull/5/).

Orderlion's ddp-apollo, which is a fork of swydo:ddp-apollo, also got a [nice set of updates](https://github.com/orderlion/ddp-apollo/pull/1/commits/db66091212cae2cf7c459cbae011b3dc07142b1d) that should make it more efficient and independent. Their fork had an underlying package that wasn't published, so I published it under [meteor-apollo-link-ddp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteor-apollo-link-ddp).
