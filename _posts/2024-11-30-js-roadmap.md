# A Practical Roadmap for Learning JavaScript and Node.js

I was recently asked by a friend to create a roadmap for learning JavaScript and Node.js. My immediate recommendation was [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), and here's why: it's free, offers world-class learning material that's continuously updated, and most importantly, includes hands-on projects that put your skills to the test.

Having concrete projects to build is crucial because newcomers often face two common challenges:
1. Paradox of choice: the overwhelming number of learning resources available
2. Analysis paralysis: difficulty deciding which path to take

freeCodeCamp's structured approach with guided projects helps overcome these challenges. However, while excellent, freeCodeCamp's curriculum could benefit from more in-depth video tutorials explaining the "why" behind concepts. That's where this roadmap comes in - it supplements freeCodeCamp's curriculum with carefully selected video courses.

## How to Use This Roadmap
The approach is simple:
1. Complete a freeCodeCamp project
2. Watch the recommended course that covers related concepts
3. Repeat

This method helps reinforce your learning and prevents the common pitfall of mindlessly completing challenges without understanding the underlying concepts.

## Part 1: JavaScript Journey
The JavaScript portion is divided into three progressive sections:

### Section 1: Fundamentals
1. Complete [Build a Palindrome Checker Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker)
2. Take [Getting Started with JavaScript v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/) on Frontend Masters

### Section 2: Modern JavaScript
1. Study [JavaScript: The Recent Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-recent-parts/)
2. Complete [Functional JavaScript v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/)
3. Build these projects:
   - [Roman Numeral Converter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-roman-numeral-converter-project/build-a-roman-numeral-converter)
   - [Telephone Number Validator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-telephone-number-validator-project/build-a-telephone-number-validator)

### Section 3: Advanced Concepts
1. Take [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/)
2. Complete [Deep JavaScript v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/)
3. Study [JavaScript: The Hard Parts v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/)
4. Build these capstone projects:
   - [Cash Register](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-cash-register-project/build-a-cash-register)
   - [Pokemon Search App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-pokemon-search-app-project/build-a-pokemon-search-app)

## Part 2: Node.js Development
The Node.js section follows a straightforward progression:

1. Start with [Command Line Interface Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwAqEzhyjtw) - This is crucial as you'll be working with web servers and databases
2. Take [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2)
3. Study [Understanding Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/)
4. Complete [Back End Development and APIs Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#back-end-development-and-apis-projects) on freeCodeCamp
