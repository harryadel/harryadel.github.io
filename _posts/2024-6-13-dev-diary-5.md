Hello there, yet again another busy month where we're working hard to migrate our application to 3.0 and we're getting closer than ever.

One of the biggest issues I struggled with after upgrading our application to 3.0 was encountering a blank page. After thorough debugging, I found out it was due to the `meteor-scss` package. Previously, I used to encourage people to try out the [activitree fork](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-scss/pull/318), but it turns out it causes errors for some users. So instead, I created a new [PR](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-scss/pull/321) that updates the `meteor-scss` dependencies to the latest versions while keeping things as they are.

I'm not the only one to report this bug; [Andrei Lisnic](https://github.com/alisnic) reported the same issue on the official [Meteor Slack](https://meteor-community.slack.com/archives/CUDJF42HL/p1717404443469969).

Also, this month I had the honor to talk with [Gabs](https://x.com/o_gabsferreira), the new Meteor developer advocate. I must say that I quite enjoyed our conversation. He agreed with many of the issues I brought up and promised changes. I believe this marks a new chapter for Meteor developer advocacy, and I anticipate great things moving forward.
