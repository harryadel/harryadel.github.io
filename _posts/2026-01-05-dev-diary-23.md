This month has been exceptionally intense for Meteor's OSS.

Starting off with the meatiest of all is the [new release](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/Packosphere/pull/40) of Packosphere. I was motivated to start this PR since whenever I'm using Claude Code or any other LLM, it fails to notice the latest Meteor package releases as it attempts to do so by a usual search lookup which might not detect the beta releases, which are nothing but PRs on the GitHub repos. So I thought it'd be a good time to do a facelift on the Packosphere repository. It's now updated to the latest RC 3.4-rc.2. Also, a couple of sub-packages were updated too:
- [socialize:base-model](https://github.com/copleykj/socialize-base-model/pull/26)
- [copleykj:grapher-link-executor](https://github.com/copleykj/grapher-link-executor/pull/1)
- [peerlibrary:meteor-packages](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-packages/pull/19)

Collection Hooks is nearing [another release](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection-hooks/pull/320) which attempts to improve its underlying structure to make future improvements much easier. It's also worth noting that a bug with Accounts.onLogin is [now fixed](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection-hooks/issues/323).

Partitioner package also received another mini-update which is aimed at fixing a bug with [projection field](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-partitioner/commit/dfccf20e2200edbd16edf3960aea25b458e7aa74).

As for Meteor itself, a few PRs were made to help improve the async experience when working with accounts packages:
- [Add loginWithTokenAsync, loginWithPasswordAsync](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/14070)
- [Asyncify client side calls](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/14069)

Lastly, there's a very important thing which the community hasn't been made aware of, which is that https://docs.montiapm.com/ is now [open source](https://github.com/monti-apm/docs). These docs represent a treasure trove of Meteor-specific knowledge on how to deal with performance, scaling, and more. It used to be part of the official Meteor docs but wasn't updated, and now since Meteor gave up its own APM in favor of Monti becoming the de facto APM for the entire Meteor community.

I'm quite grateful for this month's work as it helped push the narrative of many Meteor packages out there, and I was quite delighted to help out with Packosphere. Be sure to [support Kelly](https://github.com/sponsors/copleykj) so that he may continue his awesome work.
