Long time no see! I'm back with an exciting set of updates from the Meteor ecosystem.

## Collection2 Updates
[Collection2](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2) is about to receive a significant [update](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-collection2/pull/460) that brings several improvements:
- Complete removal of Lodash dependencies
- Updated test suite compatible with the latest Meteor release
- New feature: The package now throws native errors when no SimpleSchema is added

## SJobs Async Support
`msavin:sjobs` has finally achieved [async support](https://github.com/msavin/SteveJobs/pull/112)! This package holds a special place in my heart as it exemplifies true community collaboration. A huge shout-out to [Victor Parpoil](https://github.com/vparpoil), who demonstrated exceptional dedication throughout the async transition. Victor stands out as one of the key contributors who remained committed during this challenging period.

## Underscore Removal Milestone
After nearly two years, we've reached a historic milestone: Underscore is [no longer](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/12268) part of the Meteor core! This journey, which began in 2022 and concludes as 2024 draws to a close, has been incredibly educational. It taught me invaluable lessons about:
- Patience and perseverance in open source development
- The intricacies of community collaboration
- The importance of long-term commitment to project improvements

It has been quite a ride, and I'm grateful for all the support from the community throughout this process. Looking forward to our next adventures in the Meteor ecosystem!

Until next time!
